    \label{fig:domain-model}
\end{figure}

The domain model of KU Eater (Figure \ref{fig:domain-model}) shows the business knowledge, any technicalities are abstracted into their most simplest form. (Recommendation Engine for example)

However, some clarification may be needed as to help readers understand:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Stall can aggregate reviews from MenuItem directly, so no need to associate Review with Stall.
    \item DietaryRestriction is considered separated from UserProfile. The benefit is that DietaryRestriction can be reused for other users
    and we can specify common personal diets like: Vegetarian, Halal etc.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Class Diagram}

    \caption{Class Diagram of KU Eater}
    \label{fig:class-diagram}
\end{figure}

Class diagram (Figure \ref{fig:class-diagram}) represents a structure of application that relates closely to real implementation. The diagram
shows mainly the Data Objects that KU Eater must keep track of. Class Diagram is also expanded upon the Domain Model (see Figure \ref{fig:domain-model})
making sure that the integrity of business knowledge is intact.

\section{Sequence Diagram}
\label{section:sequence-diagram}

Sequence diagrams visualize interaction between the user and the system. The figures below show how components in the system will interact with
each other and the end-user, while the users can dispatch messages or inputs into KU Eater.

\subsection{Overall Recommendations Process}
\begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption{Sequence Diagram for Overall Recommendations Process}
    \label{fig:seq-recommendation-process}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:seq-recommendation-process} represents a sequence diagram for a process when a user is browsing KU Eater. When a user
starts to use KU Eater, the controller in our application layer will invoke the machine learning layer and generate new recommendations.

Once the recommendations are finished generating, the application requests list of recommendations and renders them back to user.

%<TIP: Optional, If you are working on a research project that proposes a new
%algorithm, you can describe your algorithm here. It can be in the form of
%pseudocode or any diagram that you deem appropriate./>

\section{Pipeline}
\label{section:pipeline}

\subsection{Modelling the Recommendation Engine}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includesvg[height=0.3\textheight,keepaspectratio]{kueater/algo_modelling.svg}
    \caption{Pipeline for Modelling the Recommendation Engine}
\end{figure}

Our recommendation engine uses a hybrid model of K-nearest neighbor (kNN)
and Gated Recurrent Unit variant of Recurrent Neural Network (GRU-RNN) as the backbone of the engine.
The models needs to be feeded relevant data such as Ingredients, Dish Names, Stalls and Scoring in which they exist in
the database. The different data must be serialized and mapped as data rows, then is preprocessed before getting into training the model. \cite{bansalandbaliyan:2023}

\subsection{Predicting the Recommendations}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includesvg[width=\textwidth,height=0.3\textheight,keepaspectratio]{kueater/algo_prediction.svg}
    \caption{Pipeline for Predicting Recommendations}
\end{figure}

The input parameters are predicted real-time in the application using our hybrid kNN-GRU model.
Before the list of items are outputted to our application, they must also be ranked with an algorithm \cite{bansalandbaliyan:2023}.

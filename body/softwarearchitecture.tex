The domain model of KU Eater shows the business logic, any technicalities are abstracted into their most simplest form. (Recommendation Engine for example)
However, some clarification may be needed as to help readers understand:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Stall can aggregate reviews from MenuItem directly, so no need to associate Review with Stall.
    \item DietaryRestriction is considered separated from UserProfile. The benefit is that DietaryRestriction can be reused for other users
    and we can specify common personal diets like: Vegetarian, Halal etc.
\end{itemize}

%<TIP: Optional, If you are working on a research project that proposes a new
%algorithm, you can describe your algorithm here. It can be in the form of
%pseudocode or any diagram that you deem appropriate./>

\subsection{Modelling the Recommendation Engine}

\end{figure}

Our recommendation engine uses a hybrid model of K-nearest neighbor (kNN)
and Gated Recurrent Unit variant of Recurrent Neural Network (GRU-RNN) as the backbone of the engine.
The models needs to be feeded relevant data such as Ingredients, Dish Names, Stalls and Scoring in which they exist in
the database. The different data must be serialized and mapped as data rows, then is preprocessed before getting into training the model. \cite{bansalandbaliyan:2023}

\subsection{Predicting the Recommendations}

    \caption{Pipeline for Predicting Recommendations}
\end{figure}

The input parameters are predicted real-time in the application using our hybrid kNN-GRU model.
Before the list of items are outputted to our application, they must also be ranked with an algorithm \cite{bansalandbaliyan:2023}.
